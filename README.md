# FS

- routes: All the routes to handle frontend query which is later redirected to specific js files
- models: models for database used through sequelize
- middlewares: to check the constraints, otp and verify JWT tokens
- templates: for HTML template files, we'll see if we can scoot it over to front
- views: serve the static/frontend

# For a better understanding of backend 

- refer to the following [link](https://bezkoder.com/node-express-sequelize-postgresql/)
- run setup and then you can use Postman to make api requests and check if database is connected
